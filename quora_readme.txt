I wrote my first neural network that has to learn to play and then hopefully master the board game Othello ('reversi').
The Othello class handles all the aspects of the game interaction i.e. the board, the possible moves, executing moves.
AI generates random weights that can be dot producted (hope thats a word) to get the decided move.
The AI then generates new weights based on the previous winner's weights.
